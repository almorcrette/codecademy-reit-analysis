# codecademy-reit-analysis
This is my solution to a Codecademy off-platform project called Real Estate Investment Trust Analysis.
The short, beginner-level project involves analysing risk, return and correlation on two REITs.
It's designed to teach basic use of Numerical Python (NumPy) using basic tools for analysing financial data.
